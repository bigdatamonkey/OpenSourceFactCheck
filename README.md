# Open Source Fact Check Project

Welcome to the OpenSource Fact-Check project repository! This repository is dedicated to the development and maintenance of our fact-checking platform, where the public can submit claims for fact-checking and our team of fact-checkers and researchers works to verify their accuracy.

## Submitting Fact-Check Requests

We encourage the public to submit fact-check requests via GitHub Issues. To submit a fact-check request, follow these steps:


1. Click on the [Issues](../../issues) tab.
2. Click on the green "New issue" button.
3. Select the "Fact-Check Request" template.
4. Fill in the required details, including a description of the claim, its source, context, and any evidence.
5. Assign the appropriate priority level if applicable.
6. Click "Submit new issue" to submit your fact-check request.

Our team of fact-checkers will review your request and work on verifying the accuracy of the claim.

**Note**:  You'll need a GitHub account to submit an issue.

##To-Do: 

- Rename the project to be OpenSource FactCheck. 

-Move the repository to be independent 

- Moving the site towards https://docusaurus.io/docs or  https://www.sphinx-doc.org then usine Github page integration or the likings 

##I'm starting an OpenSource FactCheck team

Creating an open-source fact-checking platform on GitHub is a great idea. Here's how you could approach it:

## Set up a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub for your fact-checking project.
2. Add a README file explaining the project's goals, guidelines for contributions, and how to get involved.
3. Create separate directories or folders for different aspects like resources, questions, analysis, and website content.

## Collaborate on Resources and Questions

1. Encourage community members to submit resources (articles, studies, reports) by creating new issues or pull requests in the designated resources folder.
2. Similarly, allow users to submit fact-checking questions or claims as issues in the questions folder.
3. Use labels and milestones to categorize and prioritize submissions.

## Conduct Research and Analysis

1. Assign researchers or volunteers to investigate the submitted questions or claims.
2. Researchers can create new branches, conduct their analysis, and submit their findings as pull requests in the analysis folder.
3. Implement a review process where other researchers or moderators can review and approve the analysis before merging into the main branch.

## Publish Approved Content

1. Create a separate folder or branch for the website content.
2. After an analysis is approved, create a new file or update an existing one in the website content folder with the approved analysis and relevant information.
3. Use GitHub Pages or integrate with a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo to build and publish the website directly from the GitHub repository.

## Additional Tips

- Use GitHub's built-in features like issues, pull requests, and discussions to facilitate collaboration and communication.
- Implement contribution guidelines and a code of conduct to maintain a respectful and productive environment.
- Consider using project boards or kanban boards to track the progress of submissions and analyses.
- Encourage community participation by promoting the project on relevant forums, social media, and other platforms.[1][2][3][4]

By leveraging GitHub's collaboration features and the open-source community, you can build a transparent and collaborative fact-checking platform where researchers can work together, and the approved content can be easily published to a website.

Here are some best practices for managing a community-driven fact-checking project on GitHub:

## Leverage GitHub's Collaboration Features

1. Use issues to allow community members to submit fact-checking questions or claims that need verification.[1][2][3]
2. Encourage researchers to conduct analyses by creating pull requests in a designated analysis folder.[1]
3. Implement a review process where other researchers or moderators can review and approve analyses before merging.[1]

## Foster Community Engagement

1. Create clear guidelines and a code of conduct to maintain a respectful and productive environment.[1][4]
2. Promote the project on relevant forums, social media, and platforms to attract contributors.[1]
3. Leverage translations by community members to make fact-checks accessible in multiple languages.[1]

## Maintain Organization and Transparency

1. Use separate folders or branches for resources, questions, analyses, and website content.[1]
2. Implement labels, milestones, and project boards to categorize and track submissions and progress.[1][4]
3. Encourage community participation by sharing project updates and maintaining clear documentation.[1][4]

## Automate Processes

1. Configure built-in GitHub workflows to automatically update item statuses or archive completed tasks.[4]
2. Explore GitHub Actions and the GraphQL API to automate routine project management tasks.[4]
3. Integrate with static site generators to publish approved content directly from the repository.[1]

## Prioritize Quality and Sustainability

1. Assign dedicated researchers or volunteers to investigate claims and conduct thorough analyses.[1]
2. Implement strategies for long-term community support and project sustainability.[1]
3. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable issues to enable parallel work and easier reviews.[4]

By leveraging GitHub's collaboration features, fostering community engagement, maintaining organization and transparency, automating processes, and prioritizing quality and sustainability, you can effectively manage a community-driven fact-checking project on GitHub.
